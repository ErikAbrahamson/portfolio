During his time here he has shown himself to be a diligent worker and always willing to give his best efforts at all assignments given to him. He learns new tasks quickly with minimal instruction. I have no doubt that Erik will quickly pick up whatever skills will be required in his next job, as he has with this one, and that he will be a great asset to his next employer. His pleasant personality will be missed."
